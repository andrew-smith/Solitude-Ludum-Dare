With this being my first Ludum Dare – I was thinking I’ll just use this as a learning experience to discover what I need to do BEFORE the next one. And it has been a VERY big learning experience. Also might enter the Jam next time and get a few people in and make a party of it. Because my lack of creativity and ideas started to show about halfway though.
